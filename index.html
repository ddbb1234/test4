        <p>Between 2020-2022, Syracuse Athletics spent more than double on mens athletic teams then they did the women's teams. To put it in dollars, Syracuse athletics spent $52 million on the men's teams and a little over $25 million on the women's teams in that two-year span. </p>

<p> Sure, You've seen the number 44 and heard the timeless stories of Ernie Davis ring throughout the Syracuse University campus. You've relished in the era of Boeheim and Carmelo Anthony basketball. More recently, you even got to see a Syracuse men's soccer national championship.</p>

<p>But the attention these players, coaches and teams receive aren't just because of the success they have brought to Syracuse University.<p>


        <p>It's all about one thing: Money.</p>

        <p>The classic defense of this disparity is that more people attend and watch mens sports games, so, more revenue is brought in by them. And that is true; throughout 2020-2022, Syracuse men's teams created $90 million in revenue and Syracuse women's teams generated $13 million.</p>

        <iframe title="Mens vs. Women's Sports: Total Expenses at Syracuse University " aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-qq0ty" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qq0ty/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="625" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

        <p>If you're taking this data at face value, there's not much of a conversation to be had here as to why there's an enormous gendered gap within Syracuse Athletics. But there's two huge programs at Syracuse that are tilting this data; Football and Men's Basketball.</p>

        <p>Syracuse spent $15 million on Mens basketball and almost $28 million on football over the course of 2 years. Compare this value to the women's basketball team, who, Syracuse only spent a little over $1.5 million on. </p>

        <p>So what if we take Syracuse Men's basketball and football out of the equation? Well, Syracuse athletics actually generates over double the amount of money on womens athletic teams that it does when you disclude those programs; dispite Syracuse spending more on the mens teams.</p>
<iframe title="Syracuse Athletics Revenue" aria-label="Grouped Columns" id="datawrapper-chart-VZbqL" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/VZbqL/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="537" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

</script>

<p>The imbalance that football and Men's basketball create for Syracuse athletics and its women's teams is one that takes a great toll on the athletes.</p>


        <p>Syracuse women's club soccer player Zoe Rubin says she can feel the effects of the funding imbalance.</p>

        <p>“Yea definitely,” she said.“We definitely feel the effects of not being given as much money not only as a club team but also as a women's club team. Whether that's the time slots they give us for practice or the equipment that we get to use throughout the season.”</p>

        <p>“The resources we are provided flat out suck,” she continues, "the equitment we use is mostly broken down and years old. We also dont get provided the same training staff that the mens teams do. This affects our physcial and sometimes even mental health"</p>


        <p>While women's college sports are constantly growing and expanding each year, hopefully the gender gap within Syracuse athletics does the opposite. </p>

        <p><strong>About the Data</strong><br>This data was sourced from the Equity in Athletics Data Analysis website (ope.ed.gov), the original compiler of this dataset. They collected this information through surveys sent to various college institutions. The data specifically covers Syracuse University within the NCAA Division I-FBS region from June 2020 to July 2022.</p>
